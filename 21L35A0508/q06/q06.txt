Problem Statement:
One day chef's friends were playing chess and as chef is not aware of chess, his friends explained the rules of chess. 
Chef is fond of the knight role  in the chess and he came through a question that in
 how many ways can a 2 knights be placed in a (N*N sized board) such that they don't attack each other. 
As chef is good at mathematics he found the solution and challenged his CSE friends to find the answer.
 Now it's your turn to find the number of ways that knights can be placed...

To increase  the difficulty, chef asked them to find the number of ways the 2 knights can be placed in (1 to N) squared sized board.

Input Format:
The first line consists of Testcases T
For each testcase,consists of N  value 

Output Format:
For given N value print the number of ways from 1 to N square sized board.
i.e you need to find the possibility for 1X1,2X2,3X3....and so on upto NXN and print the answer in a new line for each case.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10000

Sample Test Case 1:
Input
1
6
Output
0
6
28
96
252
550
