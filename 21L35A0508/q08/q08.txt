Problem Statement:
Chef had created a algorithm with generates elements of length n in which the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is k.
 His friends stated his algorithm is not correct. Help Chef by printing the elements which satisfies the condition so that chef can win in the arguement
Note: print the elements which satisfies the condition in the ascending order 
Leading zeroes are not considered in count of a number...

Input Format:
The first line contains T - The number of testcases
The next T lines consists of n and k seperated by space

Output Format:
For every testcase print the elements in new line seperated by space

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 100
2 <= n <= 9
0 <= k <= 9

Sample Test Case 1:
Input
1
3 6

Output
171 282 393 606 717 828 939

Explanation
For 171 -> abs(1,7)=6
           abs(7,1)=6

For 282 -> abs(2,8)=6
           abs(8,2)=6

similarly for all elements the condition satisfied
