Problem Statement:

Raghni is good at logical thinking but she is unable to code.
So she is asking you to solve the following problem:

You are given an integer N, which contains two set of integers A and
B. In which set A contains 1 to N. And set B contains N+1 to
2N. Now there is a set C which is formed from the sum of 
values of sets A and B. 

For example, if N equals 3 then 
A={1,2,3},B={4,5,6} and C={5,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,9}.

You are  given M queries find the frequency of a given number in set 
C.
Here frequency of 7 is 3 so output should be 3.

Input Format:

First line contains T -> The number of testcases

For each testcase:
First line contains N and M where N denotes the number of
integers and M denotes the number of queries.

The next M lines contains the queries.

Output Format:

Output the frequency for each query in a new line

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000

1 <= N <= 10^9

1 <= M <= 10^5

1 <= Q <= 3*N

Sample Test Case 1:
Input
1
5 6
11
8
9
5
12
20
Output
5
2
3
0
4
0

Explanation
Here N value is 5. So set A={1,2,3,4,5} set B={6,7,8,9,10}

set C=A+B => C={7,8,8,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,12,13,13,13,14,14,15} 
So,
- 11 occurs 5 times 

- 8 occurs 2 times

- 9 occurs 3 times

- 5 is not present in C

- 12 occurs 3 times

- 20 is not present in C
