The parity party

In a land where numbers ruled, there was a gathering of digits. They had a special way of categorizing themselves - some were even and some were odd.
One sunny day, they decided to hold a celebration. If all the digits in their group were even parity bit,  they would declare it a "Happy" day and dance with delight. But if even one odd parity bit dared to join the party, a shadow would fall, and they would feel "Unhappy."
Note: Digit is said to be an even parity bit if total count of '1' bits is even within its binary representation.
