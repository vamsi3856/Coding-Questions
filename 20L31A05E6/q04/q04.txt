Harmony in Numbers: The Odd and Even Alliance

Once upon a time, in a land of numbers, there was a magical matrix. Each row had its own special powers - some loved odd-numbered columns, while others were drawn to even-numbered columns.
Set A was like a team of row heroes, adding up the magic from their odd columns. Set B, on the other hand, were the champions of even columns, summoning their own unique power.
One day, they realized they shared a secret: some numbers were loved by both sets. These special numbers were like bridges between their worlds, bringing them together.
In the end, they decided to gather these common numbers and present them in a grand list, all in ascending order. It was a harmonious union of odd and even, proving that in the world of numbers, unity could be found even in their differences.
