The Alphabet Arrangement Challenge 

You and I were eager to learn Machine learning from the wise and experienced Tom. However, Tom had a condition - he would only share his knowledge once we successfully tackled a particular puzzle.
This puzzle was known as the "Alphabet Arrangement Challenge". We were presented with a combination of letters (a-z) and tasked with creating a new combination. The rules were as follows:
1. An alphabet which is repeated more should be placed first.
2. Once an alphabet placed, it should not be considered again. for ex a is the most repeated letter in a string, count of 'a' is 5, after placing 'a', the count of 'a' will become 4.
3. In the case of multiple alphabets repeated the same number of times, the alphabet which comes first in (a-z) should be placed first.
Determined to kickstart our journey into Machine learning, we eagerly accepted the challenge. 

Input Format :
The first line an integer 'len' representing the length of the string.
The second line contain a string.

Output Format:
Output a string by following the rules.

Constraints
1<=t<=10^2
1<= length of string <= 10^2

Sample Input:
abcdccbacbcbc

Sample Output:
cbcdbcdabcdabcd
